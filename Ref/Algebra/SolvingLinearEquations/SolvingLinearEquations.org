* Solving Linear Equations

** Clearing the fraction
\[
-\frac{1}{3}(x+2)=0
\]

find the [[*fraction][reciporical of the fraction]]

\[
-\frac{1}{3} \rightarrow -\frac{3}{1}
\]


simplify

\[
-3
\]

Multiply both sides by \(-3\):

\[
-3\left(-\frac{1}{3}(x+2)\right) = -3 \cdot 0
\]

\[
x+2=0
\]

Subtract \(2\) from both sides:

\[
x=-2
\]

** taking the sqrt
3(x + 2)^2 will always be ≥ 0
so to find the vertex we just need to find when the expression inside the square is 0
thus the squared term becomes 0 and only the -4 remains, giving the vertex
