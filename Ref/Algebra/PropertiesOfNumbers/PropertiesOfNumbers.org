* Properties of numbers

** Reciporcal
- A reciprocal is the multiplicative inverse of a number.
-It is used when solving equations, simplifying expressions,
 and working with fractions.
**** int
The reciprocal of an integer is found by placing the integer in the denominator of a fraction.

\[
5 \rightarrow \frac{1}{5}
\]

Check:

\[
5 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1
\]

**** fraction
The reciprocal of a fraction is found by swapping the numerator and denominator.

\[
\frac{2}{7} \rightarrow \frac{7}{2}
\]

Check:

\[
\frac{2}{7} \times \frac{7}{2} = 1
\]

**** decimal
First convert the decimal into a fraction, then take the reciprocal.

\[
0.4 = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Now swap the numerator and denominator:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \rightarrow \frac{5}{2}
\]

Check:

\[
0.4 \times 2.5 = 1
\]

**** negative
The reciprocal keeps the negative sign.

\[
-3 \rightarrow -\frac{1}{3}
\]

Check:

\[
-3 \times -\frac{1}{3} = 1
\]

**** variable
A variable also has a reciprocal, as long as it is not zero.

\[
x \rightarrow \frac{1}{x}, \quad x \neq 0
\]

Check:

\[
x \times \frac{1}{x} = 1
\]

** Factoring
Find the factors of \(10\).

Start by testing whole numbers that divide into \(10\).

\[
10 \div 1 = 10
\]
So:
\[
1 \cdot 10 = 10
\]

Next, try \(2\).

\[
10 \div 2 = 5
\]
So:
\[
2 \cdot 5 = 10
\]

Next, try \(3\).

\[
10 \div 3 = 3.33\ldots
\]
This is not a whole number, so \(3\) is not a factor of \(10\).

Next, try \(4\).

\[
10 \div 4 = 2.5
\]
This is not a whole number, so \(4\) is not a factor.

Next, try \(5\).

\[
10 \div 5 = 2
\]
So:
\[
5 \cdot 2 = 10
\]
This is the same pair as \(2 \cdot 5\), so we stop.

Now include the negative factors, since a negative times a negative is positive.

\[
(-1) \cdot (-10) = 10
\]

\[
(-2) \cdot (-5) = 10
\]

So the full list of factors of \(10\) is:

\[
1,\;2,\;5,\;10,\;-1,\;-2,\;-5,\;-10
\]
