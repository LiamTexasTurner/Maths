* Properties of numbers

** Reciporcal
- A reciprocal is the multiplicative inverse of a number.
-It is used when solving equations, simplifying expressions,
 and working with fractions.
**** int
The reciprocal of an integer is found by placing the integer in the denominator of a fraction.

\[
5 \rightarrow \frac{1}{5}
\]

Check:

\[
5 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1
\]

**** fraction
The reciprocal of a fraction is found by swapping the numerator and denominator.

\[
\frac{2}{7} \rightarrow \frac{7}{2}
\]

Check:

\[
\frac{2}{7} \times \frac{7}{2} = 1
\]

**** decimal
First convert the decimal into a fraction, then take the reciprocal.

\[
0.4 = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Now swap the numerator and denominator:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \rightarrow \frac{5}{2}
\]

Check:

\[
0.4 \times 2.5 = 1
\]

**** negative
The reciprocal keeps the negative sign.

\[
-3 \rightarrow -\frac{1}{3}
\]

Check:

\[
-3 \times -\frac{1}{3} = 1
\]

**** variable
A variable also has a reciprocal, as long as it is not zero.

\[
x \rightarrow \frac{1}{x}, \quad x \neq 0
\]

Check:

\[
x \times \frac{1}{x} = 1
\]
