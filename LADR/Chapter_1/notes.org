* Comples Numbers

  - A complex number is an ordered pair (a,b) where a,b ∈ R,
    a is the real part and b is the imaginary part

  - The Set of All Complex Number is denoted by C
    C = {a + bi : a,b ∈ R}    
   (: → “such that” or “where” )
   so C means the set of all complex numbers expressed  as *a + bi* where *a,b ∈ R*
   
  - i is defined as the complex number 0 + 1i
    The symbol i only appears when we write the number, not when we store it.
    so
    {0.0, 1.0}  = 0 + 1i
    {3.5, -2.0} = 3.5 - 2i

     
** adition
    (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d) i
    
** Mult    
    (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i

    
    verify i^2 = -1
    file:c:/scratch/Math/LADR_1/main.c::17
    because i is defined as 0 + 1i we store it as the complex number (0,1)
    0 the real part, 1 the imaginary part
    then when we compute i * i (or i^2)
    following the rules of complex number multiplication we get -1
    so i^2 = the real number -1

    take complex number (2,6)
    expands to this
    real number a = 2 = (2,0)
    real number b = 6 = (6,0)
    i = (0,1)
    (2,0) + 6(0,1)

** complex conjugate

    z=a+bi

    then the conjugate is
    
    z‾=a−bi
    z
    =a−bi
    What it implies
    - Same real part
    - Opposite imaginary part
    - Mirror image across the real axis

*** Exercises 1.A
 Suppose a and b are real numbers, not both 0. find real numbers c and d such that

 \[
 \frac{1}{a+bi} = c +di
\]

 
**** notes
What the problem is asking
You are given a complex number in the denominator:


s
\[
\frac{1}{a+bi} 
\]

and you’re asked to rewrite it in the standard complex form

$$c+di$$

where c and d are real numbers

***** what intuition do we get from question
1. complexnumbers behave like real numbers under division
   
2. Conjugates are the key tool for division
   
3. the magnitude $$a^2+b^2$$ controls the size of the reciporcal

4. Complex numbers as points on the plane
   - The solution depends on $$a2+b2$$

   - That expression is exactly the distance formula from the origin

   - The conjugate \(a - bi\) is exactly a mirror reflection

   - Those two facts only make sense geometrically if:
     \(a+bi \leftrightarrow (a,b)\)

   - Complex numbers behave like vectors in the plane, and their arithmetic corresponds to geometric operations.

***** fisrt ideas
so this works because complex numbers themselves alsnmost represent a 2d
plane so opperations on them is almost like doing 2d vector math?
